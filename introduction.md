The Ising Model is an excellent tool to make use of when investigating physical properties of ferromagneric materials. It is a simplified model that


It is a simple model, describing the environment within and  in which a lattice structured material with quantized spin strives to obtain a state of equilibrium.

In this report we present theory needed to create an Ising model in two dimensions using c++, and then use this model to learn and confirm knowledge about time-dependent behaviour of ferromagnets. Numerically estimate critical temperature \\

What is the icing model, Markov chain Monte Carlo method, parallelization 
spins \\

We want to create an accurate Ising model, and use this to test theory and further explore temperature-dependent behaviour with ferromagnets


'The aim is to study phase transitions, and to do so we need to create a model for underlying many-particle interaction. To do this we make use of the Ising model. 
"The Ising model simulates a two-dimensional model for a magnet composed of many small atomic magnets" (CP). By making use of this model, we can obtain descriptions of how a magnetic material responds to thermal energy. The ising model undergoes a phase transition of second order, which means that below a critical temperature $T_C$, the model exhibits a spontaneous magnetization. Above $T_C$ the magnetization is zero.  '
